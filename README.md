The master branch is protected and should not be committed to directly. To add stuff to the project, create a branch entitled "myname/my-cool-feature" and push this to the repository. Then open a merge request on GitHub to merge your new branch into master - this must be reviewed by another group member before it is accepted.

Example of doing this:

    git checkout -b myname/my-cool-feature
    # ... do some stuff
    git add file1 file2 file3
    git commit -m "I did some stuff"
    git push origin myname/my-cool-feature
    # now go to GitHub and open a merge request for 'myname/my-cool-feature' to 'master'
