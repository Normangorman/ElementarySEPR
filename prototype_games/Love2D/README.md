Download Love2D
=====

Get LOVE by downloading the Windows installer from https://love2d.org/.
This will install LOVE to /c/Program Files/LOVE.

Run the game
=====

The easiest way to run the game is to make a shortcut to love.exe from the LOVE directory.
Place the shortcut in this directory (the one with main.lua), then drag the entire directory on top of the shortcut - this should run the game.
Alternatively add /c/Program Files/LOVE to your PATH, then open a terminal in this directory and type "love.exe ."
